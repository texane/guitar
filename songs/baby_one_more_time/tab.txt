Oh, baby, baby, how was I supposed to know
Am              G                  E

That something wasn't right here?
F                     G     Am

Oh, baby, baby, I shouldn't have let you go
Am              G                    E

And now you're out of sight, yeah
F                     G      Am

Show me how you want it to be
C       C               E

Tell me, baby,
Am

'Cause I need to know now, oh, because...
Am            F            G   Am

My loneliness is killing me and I
Am            E             C (with pinkie stuff)

I must confess, I still believe, still believe
C               Dm               E

When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Am                    E

Give me a sign
C

Hit me, baby, one more time
F       G     E        Am
