I needed you like the moon needs the sky
F                     G              Am

but you left me in the dark here tonight
we had something that money could never buy
but you ruined it with all your twisted lies
bad bitches dont cry we just get even even
so raise your fist yeah raise it to the sky
and just keep believing living
cause if there is something
that Ive ever learned is
if you play with fire
you are bound to be burnt yeah
bad bitches dont cry
