Am                        F
Elevator straight into my skull
Am                        F
the escalator rises as it falls
G                                 F
i swear our jet is crashing in my mind
G                                         Am
you can hold on but i wouldn't waste your time

Chorus:
F                 Am
Farewell my black balloon
F                 Am
Farewell my black balloon

A             G             Dm               A
Ah ah ah ah - ah ah ah ah - ah ah ah ah ah - ah ah ah ah x2
