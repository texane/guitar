Pinned like a note in a hospital gown

Prison of sleep

Deeper down
E      C
The rabbit hole never to be found ... again

Where are you hiding, my love?
Am                    C
Cast off like a stone. Feelings,
G               F
Raw and exposed when I'm out of control
Am      C            E
Pieces were stolen from me
Am     C
Or dare I say, given away ?
G              F
Watching the water give in
Am       C
As I go down the drain

I appear missing now

I go missing,

No longer exist

One day, I hope,

Tear me apart
Am
Pinned like a note in a hospital gown

Deeper I sleep
Am     E
Further down

The rabbit hole never to be found

Because you hit the ground
E               F
